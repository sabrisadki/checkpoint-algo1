README file for the ALGORITHM Counter
This program is designed to count the number of characters, words, and vowels in a sentence entered by the user.

How to use
When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter a sentence that ends with a period.
Once you have entered your sentence, the program will count the number of characters, words, and vowels.
The results will be displayed on the screen.
Variables
SENT: This variable stores the sentence entered by the user.
COUNT1: This variable is used to count the number of characters in the sentence.
COUNT2: This variable is used to count the number of words in the sentence.
COUNT3: This variable is used to count the number of vowels in the sentence.
Algorithm
The program prompts the user to enter a sentence.
The program reads the sentence and stores it in the SENT variable.
The program uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the sentence.
For each character, the program increments COUNT1 by 1.
If the character is a space, the program increments COUNT2 by 1.
If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), the program increments COUNT3 by 1.
Once the loop has finished iterating through all the characters in the sentence, the program displays the results.
Output
The program displays the following information about the input sentence:

The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
The number of words in the sentence.
The number of vowels in the sentence.
Note
The program assumes that the user will enter a sentence that ends with a period.
The program does not count punctuation marks as words.
